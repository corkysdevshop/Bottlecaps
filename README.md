# Bottlecaps

## An open source continuous innovation social network

Bottlecaps is a continuous innovation application where users can share ideas across spaces. Spaces can be anything, from a conference room to a medical field or bus stop. The ideas are encapsulated in 'Bottlecaps,' which are virtual nodes that connect tags and links. 

This project aims to create social bonds between those with similar interests, so users can explore new perspectives of their interests, which has the potential to generate a deeper understanding from which new inventions can be created.
